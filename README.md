Hyperledger Fabric Developer Certification Training - Assessment

A technical assessment to the Hyperledger Fabric Certification eligibility.

The first ruby file, factorial.rb answers Question 1 of Section 1 of the assessment, which is to build a factorial function and calculate the sum of the factorial numbers individually. For example, 10! = 3628800. The sum of the individual digits in 3628800 = 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

The two other files, bank.rb and bank-2.rb represents the two approach I chose to solve this problem. The essence of the functions required are there. 

As these files are in Ruby, to run them simply download them and run them via the Command Line Interface (CLI) like Terminal etc. To run a ruby file, type: ruby <filename.rb>

Thank you!
